# Scenario Library – Quantified Outcomes & Munin Applicability

Generated by `munin scenarios analyze`.

## When Munin Applies (coordination/authorisation bottleneck)

### Hurricane Katrina (2005)

- **Coordination delay (actual):** 3-5 days
- **Deaths attributed:** 1300
- **Damage:** $161B
- **Munin projected improvement:**
  - authorization_time: 2-6 hours → 20 minutes
  - lives_saved: 400-600 (30-45% reduction)
  - damage_prevented: $20-40B
  - confidence: MEDIUM
- **Evidence:** Official reports cite 'time consuming approval signatures', FEMA-state-local coordination failure
- **Applicability score:** 0.95

### Fukushima Nuclear (2011)

- **Coordination delay (actual):** 7+ hours (venting decision)
- **Deaths attributed:** 51
- **Munin projected improvement:**
  - authorization_time: 7 hours → 15 minutes
  - lives_saved: 20-35 (evacuation coordination)
  - meltdown_prevention: POSSIBLE (earlier venting)
  - confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH
- **Evidence:** TEPCO-government coordination failure documented; 7-hour venting delay despite approval
- **Applicability score:** 0.92

### September 11 (WTC) (2001)

- **Coordination delay (actual):** Hours (FDNY/NYPD incompatible radios; collapse warning not relayed)
- **Deaths attributed:** 343
- **Munin projected improvement:**
  - authorization_time: Multi-agency alignment in minutes
  - lives_saved: 50-100+ (faster coordinated withdrawal)
  - confidence: MEDIUM
- **Evidence:** FDNY/NYPD/Port Authority communication failure; helicopter warning never reached FDNY
- **Applicability score:** 0.88

### Storm Desmond (UK Carlisle) (2015)

- **Coordination delay (actual):** 2-6 hours (multi-agency authorisation)
- **Damage:** £500M+ (Cumbria)
- **Munin projected improvement:**
  - authorization_time: 2-6 hours → <4 minutes (demo)
  - damage_prevented: Estimated 15-25% via faster gate coordination
  - confidence: HIGH (demo-validated)
- **Evidence:** Lack of cross-government coordination; 2-6 h authorisation cycle documented
- **Applicability score:** 0.95

## When Munin Does Not Apply

### Texas Winter Storm (grid failure) (2021)

- **Reason:** Equipment failure (frozen turbines); no amount of faster authorisation generates power from broken kit
- **Applicability score:** 0.15

### Dubai Floods (2024)

- **Reason:** Drainage overwhelmed; coordination worked, physics didn’t
- **Applicability score:** 0.20

---
Confidence levels: HIGH = demo or strong evidence; MEDIUM = counterfactual from reports; LOW = speculative.
