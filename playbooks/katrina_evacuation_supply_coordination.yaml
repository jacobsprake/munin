title: Katrina Evacuation and Supply Coordination Protocol
version: 1.0
type: hurricane_evacuation

description: |
  Decision-support playbook for hurricane evacuation and supply coordination,
  informed by the 2005 Katrina baseline. Munin would have matched pre-simulated
  Gulf Coast hurricane scenarios and presented pre-validated multi-agency
  playbooks (FEMA, state, local, Red Cross) so authorisation could complete
  in minutes instead of days.

triggers:
  - condition: canal_water_level > flood_warning_threshold
    threshold: 2.5
    unit: meters
    node_id: canal_17th_street_level
    operator: ">"
  - condition: canal_water_level > flood_warning_threshold
    threshold: 2.5
    unit: meters
    node_id: industrial_canal_level
    operator: ">"
  - condition: evacuation_requests_pending > threshold
    threshold: 500
    unit: count
    node_id: evacuation_requests_pending
    operator: ">"

actions:
  - step: 1
    action: assess_levee_and_flood_severity
    target_nodes:
      - canal_17th_street_level
      - industrial_canal_level
    parameters:
      check_interval: 15m
      severity_levels:
        - warning: 2.5m
        - critical: 4.0m
    task_owner: FEMA Regional
    auto_assign: true

  - step: 2
    action: activate_evacuation_and_supply_playbook
    parameters:
      pre_positioned_meals: true
      multi_agency_sign_off: [FEMA, State, Local, Red_Cross]
      bypass_sequential_approval: pre_validated
    task_owner: FEMA PFO
    approval_required: true
    auto_assign: true

  - step: 3
    action: notify_state_and_local_authorities
    parameters:
      recipients:
        - State Emergency Ops
        - Parish EOCs
        - Red Cross
      message_template: hurricane_evacuation_supply_activation
    task_owner: Communications
    auto_assign: true

  - step: 4
    action: execute_supply_orders_without_cancel_delay
    parameters:
      meal_orders: pre_authorised
      transport: pre_contracted
    task_owner: Logistics
    approval_required: true
    auto_assign: true

regulatory_compliance:
  - act: "Stafford Act"
    requirement: "Federal assistance coordinated with state/local; FCO designated"
  - act: "FEMA policies"
    requirement: "Pre-positioned resources and pre-signed agreements for rapid release"

approval_required:
  - role: FEMA Federal Coordinating Officer
    authority: federal_emergency
    minimum_sign_off: true
  - role: State Governor / EOC
    authority: state_emergency
    minimum_sign_off: true
  - role: Red Cross (supply release)
    authority: supply_chain
    minimum_sign_off: false

expected_outcomes:
  - Multi-agency authorisation in minutes, not days
  - Pre-positioned meals and transport activated before/at landfall
  - No 37-day delay for supply orders (counterfactual: Sept 1 order honoured same week)

metrics:
  - metric: time_to_authorize
    target: < 30 minutes
    baseline: "2–5 days (Katrina: meals ordered Sep 1, delivered Oct 8)"
  - metric: coordination_latency
    target: < 15 minutes
    baseline: "Multi-day (FEMA/state/local/Red Cross coordination failure)"

risks:
  - risk: Over-centralisation
    mitigation: Pre-validated playbooks retain state/local sign-off; Munin only accelerates coordination
