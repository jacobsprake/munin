title: Power Frequency Instability - Grid Stabilization Protocol
version: 1.0
type: power_instability

description: |
  Protocol for responding to power grid frequency instability events, including
  automatic load shedding, frequency stabilization, and coordination with regional
  grid operators.

triggers:
  - condition: frequency_deviation > threshold
    threshold: 0.5
    unit: Hz
    direction: below_nominal
  
  - condition: frequency_rate_of_change > threshold
    threshold: 0.1
    unit: Hz_per_minute

actions:
  - step: 1
    action: assess_frequency_stability
    target_nodes:
      - substation_north_01
      - substation_south_01
    parameters:
      measurement_window: 1m
      stability_criteria:
        nominal: 60.0
        tolerance: 0.2
        critical_deviation: 0.5
    
  - step: 2
    action: initiate_stabilization
    parameters:
      method: automatic_load_shedding
      priority_levels:
        - critical_infrastructure: maintain
        - non_essential: shed_first
        - commercial: shed_second
    
  - step: 3
    action: coordinate_with_grid_operators
    parameters:
      communication_protocol: NERC_EOP_011
      reporting_interval: 5m
      escalation_threshold: 0.8
    
  - step: 4
    action: monitor_recovery
    parameters:
      check_interval: 30s
      recovery_criteria:
        frequency_stable: 59.8-60.2
        duration_stable: 5m
        rate_of_change: < 0.05
    
  - step: 5
    action: gradual_load_restoration
    parameters:
      restoration_rate: 10%_per_5min
      monitoring_mode: continuous
      rollback_trigger: frequency_deviation > 0.3

regulatory_compliance:
  - act: "NERC Reliability Standards"
    section: "EOP-011"
    requirement: "Maintain frequency within operational limits and coordinate with regional operators"
  
  - act: "Grid Stability Protocols"
    section: "GSP-2026-02"
    requirement: "Document all load shedding actions and restoration procedures"

approval_required:
  - role: Senior Operator
    authority: grid_operations
  
  - role: Regulatory Compliance Officer
    authority: regulatory_approval

expected_outcomes:
  - Frequency stabilized within 5 minutes
  - Critical infrastructure maintained
  - Grid coordination successful
  - Full service restoration within 30 minutes

risks:
  - risk: Insufficient load shedding capacity
    mitigation: Pre-validated load shedding tiers with automatic activation
  
  - risk: Cascading failure to adjacent regions
    mitigation: Regional coordination protocols and automatic isolation
