title: UK 2007 Flood Cross-Government Coordination Protocol
version: 1.0
type: flood

description: |
  Decision-support playbook for cross-government flood coordination,
  informed by the UK Summer 2007 floods (Pitt Review). Pre-validated
  playbooks and a single coordination layer would reduce multi-agency
  authorisation from 3–5 hours to under 5 minutes.

triggers:
  - condition: river_level > flood_warning_threshold
    threshold: 3.0
    unit: meters
    node_id: river_tewkesbury_level
    operator: ">"
  - condition: rainfall_rate > threshold
    threshold: 10.0
    unit: mm_per_hour
    node_id: rainfall_gloucester
    operator: ">"

actions:
  - step: 1
    action: assess_flood_severity
    target_nodes:
      - river_tewkesbury_level
      - rainfall_gloucester
    parameters:
      check_interval: 15m
      severity_levels:
        - warning: 3.0m
        - critical: 4.0m
    task_owner: Environment Agency
    auto_assign: true

  - step: 2
    action: coordinate_cross_government_response
    parameters:
      agencies: [Environment_Agency, Local_Authorities, Highways, Emergency_Services, Utilities]
      single_coordination_layer: true
      pre_validated_playbook: true
    task_owner: Lead Local Flood Authority
    approval_required: true
    auto_assign: true

  - step: 3
    action: notify_public_and_partners
    parameters:
      recipients:
        - Public warnings
        - Council EOCs
        - Water companies
        - Highways
      message_template: flood_warning_2007_style
    task_owner: Communications
    auto_assign: true

  - step: 4
    action: continuous_monitoring
    parameters:
      check_interval: 10m
      escalation_threshold: critical
    task_owner: EA Duty Officer
    auto_assign: true

regulatory_compliance:
  - act: "Flood and Water Management Act 2010 (post-2007)"
    requirement: "Coordinate flood risk management across authorities"
  - act: "Civil Contingencies Act 2004"
    requirement: "Effective emergency response coordination"

approval_required:
  - role: Environment Agency Duty Officer
    authority: flood_operations
    minimum_sign_off: true
  - role: Lead Local Flood Authority
    authority: local_coordination
    minimum_sign_off: true

expected_outcomes:
  - Cross-government coordination in minutes (not 3–5 hours)
  - Clear leadership and single playbook (Pitt Review recommendation)
  - Improved public and expert perception of response (counterfactual)

metrics:
  - metric: time_to_authorize
    target: < 5 minutes
    baseline: "3–5 hours (UK 2007 multi-agency coordination)"
  - metric: coordination_latency
    target: < 10 minutes
    baseline: "Lack of cross-government coordination (Pitt Review)"

risks:
  - risk: Fragmented ownership
    mitigation: Pre-agreed lead and playbook; Munin surfaces one recommended response
