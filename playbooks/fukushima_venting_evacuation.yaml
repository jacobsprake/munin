title: Fukushima Venting and Evacuation Coordination Protocol
version: 1.0
type: nuclear_emergency

description: |
  Decision-support playbook for nuclear emergency venting and evacuation,
  informed by the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi baseline. Pre-simulated cascade
  scenarios and pre-validated TEPCO–government–prefectural sign-off would
  have allowed venting and evacuation orders in minutes instead of 7+ hours.

triggers:
  - condition: reactor_containment_pressure > venting_threshold
    threshold: 0.6
    unit: MPa
    node_id: reactor1_pressure
    operator: ">"
  - condition: reactor_core_temperature > critical
    threshold: 900
    unit: "°C"
    node_id: reactor1_core_temp
    operator: ">"
  - condition: reactor_water_level_below_fuel_top
    threshold: 4.0
    unit: m
    node_id: reactor1_water_level
    operator: "<"

actions:
  - step: 1
    action: assess_containment_pressure_and_core_status
    target_nodes:
      - reactor1_pressure
      - reactor1_core_temp
      - reactor1_water_level
    parameters:
      check_interval: 5m
      venting_threshold_MPa: 0.6
    task_owner: TEPCO Plant Superintendent
    auto_assign: true

  - step: 2
    action: execute_pre_validated_venting_authorisation
    parameters:
      coordination_layer: [TEPCO, NISA, Prime_Minister_Office, Prefecture]
      pre_signed_venting_protocol: true
      single_channel_approval: true
    task_owner: NISA / Government
    approval_required: true
    auto_assign: true

  - step: 3
    action: issue_evacuation_orders_coordinated
    parameters:
      radii: [3km, 10km, 20km]
      central_and_local_simultaneous: true
    task_owner: Cabinet Office / Prefecture
    auto_assign: true

  - step: 4
    action: continuous_monitoring_and_injection
    parameters:
      seawater_injection: pre_authorised_when_cooling_lost
      check_interval: 2m
    task_owner: TEPCO Operations
    auto_assign: true

regulatory_compliance:
  - act: "Japanese nuclear emergency regulations"
    requirement: "Coordination between operator, NISA, and government"
  - act: "INES reporting"
    requirement: "Event classification and public communication"

approval_required:
  - role: TEPCO Plant Superintendent
    authority: plant_operations
    minimum_sign_off: true
  - role: NISA / Government
    authority: venting_and_evacuation
    minimum_sign_off: true
  - role: Prefecture
    authority: evacuation_orders
    minimum_sign_off: true

expected_outcomes:
  - Venting authorised and executed within 1–2 hours of threshold breach (not 7+ hours)
  - Evacuation orders coordinated central/local simultaneously
  - Reduced core damage and hydrogen explosion risk via earlier venting

metrics:
  - metric: time_to_venting_authorisation
    target: < 60 minutes
    baseline: "7+ hours (Fukushima: need ~Mar 11 21:00, approval/venting Mar 12 05:30–14:30)"
  - metric: evacuation_coordination_latency
    target: < 30 minutes
    baseline: "Hours; improvised and uncoordinated (official reports)"

risks:
  - risk: Premature or incorrect venting
    mitigation: Pre-validated scenarios and physics checks (Logic-Lock); humans still authorise
