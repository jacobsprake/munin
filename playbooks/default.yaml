# Default playbook – fallback when incident type has no specific playbook mapping.
# Used by engine/packetize.py when playbook_map has no entry for the incident type.
# Operators should assign a proper playbook for production; this is for demos and unknown types.

description: |
  Minimal fallback protocol when no scenario-specific playbook is mapped.
  Use for unknown incident types or demos only. In production, map all incident types
  to jurisdiction- and scenario-specific playbooks (e.g. via playbook_design or hand-authored YAML).

triggers:
  - condition: incident_detected
    severity: unknown

actions:
  - step: 1
    action: assess_situation
    parameters:
      check_interval: 5m
  - step: 2
    action: escalate_to_human_operator
    parameters:
      require_review: true

regulatory_compliance:
  - act: "General emergency protocols"
    section: "N/A"
    requirement: "Human operator must review and assign appropriate playbook before authorisation"

approval_required:
  - role: Senior Operator
    authority: operational_control
    minimum_sign_off: true
    biometric_handshake: false

expected_outcomes:
  - Situation assessed and escalated
  - Appropriate playbook assigned by operator before any authorisation

risks:
  - risk: No scenario-specific regulatory basis
    mitigation: Use only as fallback; map incident types to proper playbooks for production
