title: Drought Conditions - Reservoir Diversion Protocol
version: 1.0
type: drought

description: |
  Protocol for managing water resources during drought conditions by diverting
  flow from primary reservoirs to secondary reservoirs to maintain service levels.

triggers:
  - condition: reservoir_level < threshold_low
    threshold_low: 0.4
    unit: capacity_ratio

actions:
  - step: 1
    action: assess_current_levels
    target_nodes:
      - reservoir_alpha
      - reservoir_beta
    parameters:
      measurement_window: 24h
    
  - step: 2
    action: calculate_diversion_rate
    parameters:
      source_reservoir: reservoir_alpha
      target_reservoir: reservoir_beta
      diversion_percentage: 40
      max_diversion_rate: 1000
      unit: gallons_per_minute
    
  - step: 3
    action: initiate_diversion
    target_nodes:
      - pump_station_01
      - pump_station_02
    parameters:
      flow_rate: calculated
      duration: until_recovery
      monitoring_interval: 5m
    
  - step: 4
    action: monitor_impact
    parameters:
      check_interval: 15m
      alert_thresholds:
        pressure_drop: 10%
        flow_instability: 5%

regulatory_compliance:
  - act: "2024 Drought Resilience Act"
    section: "Section 4"
    requirement: "Maintain minimum service levels during declared drought conditions"
  
  - act: "Water Resource Management Standards"
    section: "WRM-2024-03"
    requirement: "Document all diversion actions with evidence and approval chain"

approval_required:
  - role: Senior Operator
    authority: operational_control
  
  - role: Regulatory Compliance Officer
    authority: regulatory_approval

expected_outcomes:
  - reservoir_beta level increases to target
  - service continuity maintained across affected regions
  - regulatory reporting requirements met

risks:
  - risk: Over-diversion leading to source depletion
    mitigation: Continuous monitoring with automatic cutoff at 20% capacity
  
  - risk: Pump failure during diversion
    mitigation: Backup pump activation protocol
