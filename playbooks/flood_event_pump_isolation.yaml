title: Flood Event - Pump Station Isolation Protocol
version: 1.0
type: flood

description: |
  Emergency protocol for isolating pump stations during flood events to prevent
  contamination and protect critical infrastructure from water damage.

triggers:
  - condition: flood_warning_issued
    severity: moderate_to_severe
  
  - condition: water_level > threshold_critical
    threshold_critical: 95
    unit: percent_capacity

actions:
  - step: 1
    action: assess_flood_severity
    target_nodes:
      - pump_station_01
      - pump_station_02
    parameters:
      check_interval: 5m
      severity_levels:
        - moderate
        - severe
        - critical
    
  - step: 2
    action: initiate_isolation_sequence
    target_nodes:
      - pump_station_01
    parameters:
      isolation_type: full
      backup_activation: automatic
      communication_required: true
    
  - step: 3
    action: activate_backup_systems
    target_nodes:
      - pump_station_02
    parameters:
      load_redistribution: 100%
      monitoring_mode: intensive
    
  - step: 4
    action: divert_flow
    parameters:
      primary_route: closed
      secondary_route: activated
      flow_redirection: reservoir_beta
    
  - step: 5
    action: continuous_monitoring
    parameters:
      check_interval: 2m
      alert_conditions:
        - backup_system_failure
        - flow_interruption
        - contamination_detected

regulatory_compliance:
  - act: "2024 Flood Resilience Act"
    section: "Section 4.2"
    requirement: "Maintain service continuity during declared flood emergencies"
  
  - act: "Water Quality Protection Standards"
    section: "WQP-2024-01"
    requirement: "Isolate affected systems to prevent contamination spread"

approval_required:
  - role: Senior Operator
    authority: emergency_operations
  
  - role: Regulatory Compliance Officer
    authority: regulatory_approval

expected_outcomes:
  - Affected pump stations isolated successfully
  - Backup systems maintain service
  - No contamination spread
  - Service restored within 24 hours post-event

risks:
  - risk: Backup system capacity insufficient
    mitigation: Pre-validated capacity models and load shedding protocols
  
  - risk: Isolation failure leading to contamination
    mitigation: Redundant isolation valves with automated monitoring
