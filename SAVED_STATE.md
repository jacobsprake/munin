# Saved state – resume later

**Saved**: Wednesday, Feb 4, 2026  
**Purpose**: Quit and come back to code later; everything you need to resume is here.

---

## When you come back

1. **Open this project** in Cursor (or your editor).
2. **Check for uncommitted work** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   If you see changes:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "WIP: save state"
   git push
   ```
3. **Resume coding** – your repo and files are in place; pick up where you left off.

- Recent work: engine improvements, observability, shadow mode, new APIs and UI (see last commit).
- Repo: `main` at commit `24ce68d` (or later if you’ve pushed since).
- No pending actions required before quitting; safe to close and return anytime.
