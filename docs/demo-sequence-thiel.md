# Munin Demo Sequence: "Thiel Objection Crusher"

**Target Duration**: 90 seconds  
**Goal**: Make reviewer stop thinking "startup product" and start thinking "inevitable national layer"

## Pre-Demo Setup

1. Ensure graph data has at least one shadow link (cross-sector edge)
2. Have a flood incident scenario loaded
3. Have at least one handshake packet ready for signing
4. Set deployment mode to "LAB DEMO"
5. Ensure sensor degradation toggle is accessible

## Demo Script

### [0:00-0:15] Shadow Link Revelation
**Action**: 
- Open Graph view
- Toggle "Show Shadow Links Only"
- Click on a substation node
- Point to amber-colored edges

**Say**: *"These are Shadow Links—dependencies we discovered from telemetry that aren't in any registry. This substation powers water pumps, but that relationship was undocumented until Munin inferred it from data correlation."*

**Key Point**: This is not consulting. The engine detected this from ugly OT data.

---

### [0:15-0:30] Evidence & Export
**Action**:
- Click on a shadow link edge
- Open evidence panel
- Show evidence windows with lag times
- Click "Export Evidence Pack"

**Say**: *"Every edge has proof: correlation windows, lag estimates, stability scores. We can export this as an evidence pack that stands up to expert review."*

**Key Point**: Hyperfluency. Not hand-waving AI—this is plumbing.

---

### [0:30-0:45] Sensor Degradation Resilience
**Action**:
- Toggle "Sensor Degradation: Drift"
- Watch edge confidence scores decrease
- Show simulation confidence bands widen

**Say**: *"When sensors degrade, Munin doesn't collapse. Confidence degrades gracefully. The simulation shows wider uncertainty bands, but the system remains operational."*

**Key Point**: Robust inference under degradation.

---

### [0:45-1:00] Pre-Validation Simulation
**Action**:
- Navigate to Simulation screen
- Scrub timeline to Flood Event marker
- Show cascade prediction
- Point to time-to-impact countdowns
- Show Latency Impact widget

**Say**: *"We simulate the cascade before it happens. Time-to-impact for each node. Before Munin: 4 hours of coordination. After Munin: 5 seconds to authorize. That's the difference between failure and survival."*

**Key Point**: Pre-validation solves the crisis in simulation.

---

### [1:00-1:15] Authoritative Handshake
**Action**:
- Click "Generate Handshake"
- Show technical verification (simulated success probability)
- Show actuator boundary statement
- Click "Sign & Authorize"
- Enter operator ID and passphrase
- Show signature hash
- Show audit log

**Say**: *"This is not a dashboard. This is a command system. The handshake converts inference into permission. Technical verification shows 94% simulated success. Actuator boundary: no direct OT writes—human authorization required. The signature hash is immutable."*

**Key Point**: Permission engine, not advice.

---

### [1:15-1:30] Sovereign Runtime
**Action**:
- Toggle connectivity to "DISCONNECTED"
- Show graph still works (from cache)
- Show simulation replay still works
- Show handshake log still accessible

**Say**: *"Sovereign by default. When central goes dark, local nodes continue. Graph browsing, simulation replay, handshake viewing—all work offline. This is anti-fragile infrastructure."*

**Key Point**: Sovereign deployment posture.

---

### [1:30-1:45] Expansion Map
**Action**:
- Navigate to Expansion Map
- Flash through three steps: Water → Power → Telecom
- Point to concrete data sources and coverage targets

**Say**: *"This is not a vague pivot. This is a monopoly plan. Step 1: Water. Step 2: Power. Step 3: Telecom. Each step has exact data sources, inference coverage targets, and regulatory frameworks. This is execution reality."*

**Key Point**: Definite plan, not slides.

---

## Closing Statement

*"Munin is not software that explains infrastructure. It is software that grants permission for infrastructure to survive. The moat is Shadow Links. The differentiator is the Authoritative Handshake. The deployment is sovereign by default."*

## Backup Points (if time permits)

- Protocol Deep-Dive: Show raw hex, decoded fields, dirty data toggles
- War Room Mode: Toggle to show increased density
- Audit Integrity: Show append-only log verification
- Evidence Pack: Open exported JSON to show structure

## Common Objections & Responses

**"This is consulting"**  
→ Show shadow link detection from telemetry, not human-drawn maps

**"Palantir will do this"**  
→ Show bottom-up OT telemetry, messy historian data, physics-like temporal links

**"It's just a dashboard"**  
→ Show handshake signing, actuator boundary, immutable audit log

**"Cloud-native is fine"**  
→ Show disconnected mode, on-prem deployment, offline capability

**"This is shallow"**  
→ Show protocol deep-dive, sensor health, dirty data truth, evidence packs
