- **Reviews & audits**: Demo reviews, env audits, documentation-vs-repo checklists
- **Backend setup**: Backend and setup notes (also see root [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) and [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../ARCHITECTURE.md))
- **One-off reports**: Thesis audit, verification report, test results, files-added checklists

For current product documentation, start at [../README.md](../README.md) or the [repository README](../../README.md).
